# Druggability_Predictor
A classification machine learning model to predict druggabilities based on properties of protein targets


## About the project
Using computational methods to predict potential drug targets early during drug discovery workflow became an essential part of drug development. Computational methods based on system approaches have the advantage of taking different properties of a molecule into account. Therefore, machine learning techniques are powerful tools that can extract relevant information from various and noisy data sets.

This Predictor shows the working basic framework of a classification model, which will be defined more complex and detailed in further steps.
